# Unbiased News App

A **Streamlit** app built with **OpenAI GPT-3** that rewrites news articles to make them informative and fact-focused by removing various kinds of bias (political, ideological, etc.), sensationalistic, fear-mongering language, hasty generalizations, anecdotal and unsupported claims, etc.

Beside a rewritten **unbiased version** of the input article, the app also outputs a **bias analysis** and a list of **logical fallacies**, if present in the input article.

### An example of a right-leaning article

Consider the following article from Breitbart titled "Biden's countdown to end Title 42: nearly 400K migrants may arrive at southern border every month"  (https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2023/04/11/bidens-countdown-to-end-title-42-nearly-400k-migrants-may-arrive-at-southern-border-every-month).

The output was the following:

>[1] Unbiased version of the article:

>In 2020, former President Donald Trump invoked Title 42 at the border to allow federal immigration officials to quickly return illegal aliens to Mexico for public health reasons. To date, more than 2.5 million illegal aliens have been removed from the United States after crossing the southern border thanks to Title 42.

>The Biden administration is expected to end the authority in about a month, which they estimate could bring close to 400,000 border crossers and illegal aliens to the border every month. The DHS Office of Immigration Statistics projects that border encounters could average 11,000 to 13,000 per day after the lifting of the Title 42 public health order, absent additional policy changes. This figure does not include the tens of thousands, every month, that could evade Border Patrol agents and successfully cross the border into the US interior.

>National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd told Fox News this week that the only deterrent currently in place is Title 42, and that the number of people released into the US since Biden has been in office could double in the next two years. The administration’s expansive Catch and Release network, which includes a massive parole pipeline, could result in hundreds of thousands of migrants being released into American communities as a result of Title 42 ending.```

>House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-TN) and Senate Republicans like Bill Hagerty (R-TN) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) are backing a plan to convert Title 42 to fight the nation’s deadly fentanyl crisis. Administration officials have said up to half a million border crossers and illegal aliens could arrive at the border every month, and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) told Breitbart News in April 2022 that he expects 30,000 border crossers and illegal aliens every day at the border without Title 42. In Tijuana, Mexico, alone, Breitbart News reported last year that up to 6,000 foreign nationals were waiting to rush the border when Title 42 ends.

>[2] Bias analysis:

>1. Sensationalism: The article uses language such as "millions of people" and "hundreds of thousands of migrants" to exaggerate the potential impact of the policy change.
>2. Opinionated language: The article uses language such as "crazy" and "deadly" to express the author's opinion.
>3. Unbalanced perspective: The article only presents the perspective of Republicans and does not include any opposing views.
>4. False balance: The article presents the views of Republicans as if they are the only valid perspective on the issue.
>5. Narrative bias: The article presents the issue in a way that reinforces a particular narrative about immigration.

>[3] Logical fallacies:

>1. Appeal to Fear: The article implies that the policy change will lead to a dangerous influx of illegal aliens.
>2. False Dilemma: The article implies that the only two options are to keep Title 42 in place or to allow a massive influx of illegal aliens.
>3. Hasty Generalization: The article implies that the policy change will lead to a certain number of illegal aliens crossing the border without providing evidence to support this claim.
>4. Post Hoc: The article implies that the policy change will lead to a certain number of illegal aliens crossing the border without providing evidence to support this claim.
>5. Slippery Slope: The article implies that the policy change will lead to a massive influx of illegal aliens without providing evidence to support this claim.*

### An example of a liberal/left-leaning article

Consider the following article from the Guardian titled "Misogyny is a mighty force on the right – just look at the fate of Finland’s Sanna Marin" (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/apr/04/misogyny-finland-sanna-marin).

The output was the following:

>[1] Unbiased version of the article:

>In late 2019, Sanna Marin became Finland's youngest ever prime minister and the fourth youngest state leader in the world. Her tenure has been marked by her response to the Covid-19 pandemic, her announcement that Finland would apply to join NATO in May 2022, and her social and fiscal policies. In the summer of 2020, video footage of her at a party leaked, leading to speculation and a drugs test which she passed.

>In the 2023 election, Marin and her Social Democratic party fought on three issues: education from early years to university, access to healthcare, and language and other support for migrants so that they might participate faster in Finnish society. The centre-right National Coalition party won the election with 20.8% of the vote, while the far-right Finns party took 20.1%. The other, smaller parties that had formed part of Marin’s governmental coalition (the Greens, the Left Alliance, the Centre party and the Swedish People’s party) took about 30% between them.

>Throughout the election, Marin's personal popularity remained high, and her party trusted. People accepted the state of emergency and were (somewhat) happy to participate with the national tracking app. Public debt had leapt by the end of the pandemic, and this is what the NCP fought her on.

>The coming coalition will be hard to fudge. Sanna Marin has described the Finns party as openly racist, and neither the SDP nor the smaller parties of her outgoing government will want to ally with them.

>[2] Bias analysis:

>1. Sensationalism: The original article uses sensational language to describe the events, such as "witch-hunt" and "precipitous descent into authoritarian prospects".
>2. Opinionated language: The article contains language that expresses the author's opinion, such as describing the NCP's victory as "unimaginably narrow" and the far-right Finns party as "openly racist".
>3. Unbalanced perspective: The article focuses on the negative aspects of the election results, such as the rise of the far-right Finns party, without providing a balanced perspective.
>4. Ideological bias: The original article contains ideological bias, as it portrays Marin's policies in a positive light.
>5. Narrative Bias: The article creates a narrative of Marin being unfairly targeted and her party's victory being a bad thing, without providing any evidence to back up these claims. 

>[3] Logical fallacies:

>1. False Dilemma: The article implies that Marin's victory was the only option for a positive outcome, without mentioning any other potential solutions. 
>2. Hasty generalization: The article implies that the NCP's victory is indicative of a larger trend of right-wing politics in Finland, without providing evidence to support this claim. 
>3. Appeal to Emotion: The original article appeals to emotion by using language such as "witch-hunt" and "precipitous descent into authoritarian prospects".
>4. Slippery Slope: The article implies that the NCP's victory will lead to an authoritarian government, without providing evidence to support this claim.
>5. Appeal to Fear: The original article makes an appeal to fear by suggesting that the coalition between the NCP and the Finns party is "more dangerous than you could possibly imagine".
